//this is not actual applicable .just an practise about form
// why to use form tag - The <form> tag allows you to manage and submit a collection of related input values as a single unit.
//It provides a way to group related input elements together and manage their submission as a unit. When you submit a <form>, the browser sends a request to the server, including all the form data.
//It simplifies the process of collecting user input and sending it to the server. also for validation.
//can attach an onSubmit event handler to the form, which gives you control over what happens when the user submits the form, such as performing actions like sending data to a server or triggering client-side logic.
